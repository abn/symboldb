* Write some documentation, including a manual page.

* Write a real makefile which supports incremental builds.

* Check portability of the sources to non-Fedora systems.

* Do not copy full RPM files into memory.  Stream them to directly to
  disk when downloading them.

* Add proper locking to guard against multiple parallel downloads and
  parallel RPM package loading (by multiple symboldb processes running
  in parallel).  This is mostly a performance issue.  The current code
  might perform unnecessary downloads and abort on database update
  conflicts, but it should not produce data.

* Better logging, in particular of network activity.  Final URLs after
  redirection should be included in error messages.

* Retry failed downloads.  Especially with download.fedoraproject.org,
  some downloads fail initially, but succeed when attempted again.

* Reimplement the ELF ld.so emulation outside PostgreSQL.  The current
  implementation is rather slow and slightly buggy because it may pick
  the wrong DSO in case of soname collisions (which are fortunately
  rare).

* Implement removal of stale RPM cache entries not referenced by any
  package set.

* Parallelize downloading.

* Support extracting Java symbols (class, method, field definitions
  and references).

* Support for extracting Python symbols.  This probably needs a some
  flow analysis to give good results.

* Parallelize RPM parsing and database loading.  It is not entirely
  clear if this is beneficial on small systems, but it will probably
  help if symboldb ever runs on real server systems.

* Support unattended operation.  The package set <-> compose URL
  mapping should probably reside in the database, and a single command
  (which can be run from cron) could use that to update all package
  sets.  This also relies on better logging/diagnostics and improved
  error recovery.

* Provide a workaround for non-UTF-8 paths in some broken RPM
  packages.  These file names should probably be treated as
  ISO-8859-1.
